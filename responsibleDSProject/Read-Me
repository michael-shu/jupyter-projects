This was my partner, Alexis, and my attempt to create a nutritional label.

A nutritional label being an audit of an automated data system(ADS) that takes in data, and makes predictions about it. Our goal was to analyze how well the ADS made
these predictions, what steps they took that were proper or not to cleaning and formatting the data, as well as spotting any discriminatory practices in the ADS. This
analysis makes up the "nutritional label".
